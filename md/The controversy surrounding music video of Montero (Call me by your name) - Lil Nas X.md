​    Lil Nas X released his first album *Montero* on September 17, 2021, in which he does not hide his identity as a Queer, especially in the music video, he showed it openly. In the music video for *Montero (Call me by your name)* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swmTBVI83k), he was widely criticized for several scenes, including Lil Nas X grabbing a pole and doing pole dancing, sliding into hell and giving Satan a lap dance and assassinated Satan. Interpreting the music video from the creator's perspective, I see it as Lil Nas X's response to his detractors. After he announced his coming out, he was attacked by many conservatives. Lil Nas X insinuated this by acting out his trial in the music video, in which the audience picks up rocks and throws them at him, that scene corresponds to the right of everyone to speak out and criticize on social media. When he is sentenced to hell in the music video, he does not resist the outcome, but he changes into a more sultry costume and falls into hell with exaggerated actions. The plot design of the music video shows Lil Nas X's playful attitude, as he acts as if to say, "If gays are going to hell, so be it, I am still me."

​    However, detractors read a negative connotation into this, as Lil Nas X kills Satan after pleasing him in hell in the video, takes Satan's crown and grows a pair of black wings, which could be construed as religious blasphemy or anti-Christ, especially with the religious elements that appear in the video, such as the opening scene in the Garden of Eden, where Lil Nas X plays Eve, who is tempted by the serpent. One critic tweeted, "Lil Nas X is praised for dancing on satan. Kanye West is bashed for giving his life to Christ. Welcome to 2021." (Chan)

​    From my perspective, Lil Nas X has no ill will towards religion perse. He appreciates and is willing to use biblical allusions, metaphors and elements, but he has suffered from the persecution of the LGBTQ community by religious traditions, so it was not until he became famous that he dared to choose to cheat and face the lack of understanding from the outside world. So Montero's music video represents his courage to defy the sexual binary and respond to his critics. "Showed my 3 month old niece the call me by your name video and she said "uncle that was quite the stupendous visual, why in heavens would any individual be enraged over such a sensational showpiece, I'm gonna go cry yall" (https:// twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1375542490875322371) Lil Nas X tweeted this. More than a tit-for-tat, he seeks understanding for himself and the LGBTQ community.
